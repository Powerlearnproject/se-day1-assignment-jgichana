Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is the process of using engineering principles and methods to design, develop, test, implement and maintain software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages such as C, BASIC, Ada
- Establishing software engineering as a discipline
- Introduction of structured programming which allowed programs to be broken down into manageable sections.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- System Requirements - this involves gathering user and system needs
- Design - it involves creating high level designs of the software architecture the UI
- Implementation - this involves writing code and building the software based on the specified design
- Testing - it invoves conducting tests to ensure software system quality and that the standards have been met.
- Deployment - this involves releasing the software to users after it has met the standards after testing
- Maintenance - this refers to keeping the software up to date with the necessary tools as well as support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall Methodology emphasises the sequential flow of the SLDC phases from top to bottom while the Agile Methodology emphaises the iterative and incremental approach to development and focuses on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A software developer - Incharge of writing code and implementing software products
- A quality assurance engineer - Is in charge of ensuring the quality of the software through testing
- A project manager - in charge of overseeing the planning, executing and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- An IDE is a software with the tools to test, debug and write code
- A VCS is a software used to track changes made to source code and enhance collaboration among team members in a project

Examples of IDEs - Netbeans, Microsoft Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
Examples of VCS - Git, GitLab, BeanStalk

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Tight Deadlines that make it hard for developers to finish the product on time
- Lack of funds to continue developing the software
- Clients changing requirements during the development stages

        Strategies
- Clear communication between developers and clients
- Using agile methodologies
- Prioritizing tasks 
- Assesing the progresses and timeliness of the development

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing - this is testing the modules or sections of the program
- Integretaion testing - this is testing the interaction of the software with other subsystems or components
- System testing - this is testing the whole software 
- Acceptance testing - this is testing the software to see if it meets the requirements given by the client


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 - Prompt engineering is the process of asking clear and concise questions to AI models in order to get relevant and precise responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague prompt - "Generate an image". 
- Clear prompt - "Generate an image of a lion in a zoo"
The improved prompt is more effective since it specifies what kind of image is to be generated.
